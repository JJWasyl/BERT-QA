problems that can be solved in theory ( e. g., given large but finite time ), but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful, are known as intractable problems. in complexity theory, problems that lack polynomial - time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs. in fact, the cobham \u2013 edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are exptime - hard. if np is not the same as p, then the np - complete problems are also intractable in this sense. to see why exponential - time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting. for small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 \u00d7 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. even with a much faster computer", "5ad56e5c5b96ef001a10aea2": "", "56e1febfe3433e1400423236": "presburger", "56e1febfe3433e1400423237": "", "56e1febfe3433e1400423238": "np - complete knapsack problem", "56e1febfe3433e1400423239": "over a wide range of sizes", "56e1febfe3433e140042323a": "np - complete boolean satisfiability problem", "5ad56ef05b96ef001a10aea8": "", "5ad56ef05b96ef001a10aea9": "", "5ad56ef05b96ef001a10aeaa": "", "5ad56ef05b96ef001a10aeab": "", "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c14": "what tactic did researchers employ to offset the former deficit of work surrounding the complexity of algorithmic problems?

increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. this means the basic \" worker \" rights in tfeu article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in tfeu articles 18 to 21. according to the court of justice, a \" worker \" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \" under the direction of another person \" for \" remuneration \". a job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. for example, in steymann v staatssecretaris van justitie, a german man claimed the right to residence in the netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and

meant pursuing activity more \" on a temporary basis \". this meant that a lawyer from stuttgart, who had set up chambers in milan and was censured by the milan bar council for not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. however, the requirements to be registered in milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non - discriminatory, \" justified by imperative requirements in the general interest \" and proportionately applied. all people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self - employed, or \" undertakings \" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. the court of justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both \" vertical \" and \" horizontal \" direct effect. in reyners v belgium the court of justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the belgian bar because he lacked belgian nationality was unjustified. tfeu article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others'freedom of establishment when they

another lining the internal cavity. in ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep. some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration. increasing awareness of the differences persuaded more recent authors to classify them as

and developed its neural cells? the relationship of ctenophores to the rest of metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. it has been the focus of debate for many years. ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the bilateria, sister to the cnidaria, sister to cnidaria, placozoa and bilateria, and sister to all other animal phyla. a series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways ( e. g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels ) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to cnidaria, placozoa and bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. this position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages ( e. g., porifera ) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. however, other researchers have argued that the placement of ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that porifera (
